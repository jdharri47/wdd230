      <p class="whitespace">
        The Apple website does a good job of utilizing white space and keeping a neat
        design. 
        They are not afraid of white space but use it to call attention to the content they wish to show.
        There is an appropriate amount of padding and margins to keep the website neat and clean.

      <h3 class="alignment">Alignment</h3>
      <img src="img/amazon-screenshot.png" alt="screenshot of amazon website" class="alignment">
      <p class="alignment">The alignment of the items on the amazon website is amazing.
        it makes scrolling through to find what you're looking for so easy. 
        The alignment of the page keeps it simple and easy to use.
      </p>
      <h3 class="visualhierarchy">Visual Hierarchy</h3>
      <img src="img/vernalcinema-screenshot.png" alt="screenshot of vernalcinema website" class="visualhierarchy">
      <p class="visualhierarchy">The visual hierarchy of this site helps focus the visiter of the site to stay focused on their
        purpose. First the banner of the site draws attention to the logo and name of the cinema. Then the
        next largest thing is the movies being played then the times. It all draws your eye in a natural way.
